# 📱 Stremery – The AI-Powered Fake Livestream Simulator

Stremery is a unique Flutter-based mobile app that simulates a livestreaming environment — complete with camera feed, fake viewer chat, AI-generated commentary, and more. Built entirely offline-first with on-device and API-driven AI interaction, it's perfect for solo creators, performance artists, or anyone exploring the psychology of online streaming.

## ✨ Features

- 🎙️ **Live Speech Transcription**\
  Uses your device's microphone to capture and transcribe what you say.

- 🧠 **AI-Powered Chat Summaries**\
  Transcribed speech is sent to Gemini (Google AI) which returns a fake viewer comment summarizing what you're saying.

- 💬 **Fake Chat Interface**\
  The AI summaries are displayed as fake livestream comments, each from a rotating pool of viewer usernames.

- 📷 **Front Camera Feed**\
  The app shows your real-time front camera feed behind a semi-transparent chat overlay.

- ⚙️ **Zero Backend Required**\
  All logic is handled on-device or via a single API call (to Gemini).

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Open the app and grant mic/camera permissions.
2. Press the mic button and start talking.
3. Your speech is transcribed live.
4. The transcript is sent to Gemini, which returns a 1–2 sentence summary.
5. The summary is displayed as a fake viewer chat message with a fake username.
